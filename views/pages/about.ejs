						<p>Hello there, my name is Emilie. I have been a professional dog walker for the past 10+ years.</p>

						<p> I became a dog walker as I missed having dogs in my life, when I was growing up I always had dogs in my life. I had a German Shorthaired Pointer called Daisy and, a cheeky Cairn Terrier called Devo. Years later, working in the city and renting, I found myself dogless and even worse petless only having tropical fish to call my own, they were pretty and relaxing but couldn't offer the companionship a dog or cat could, I missed having them in my life! I started to walk a couple of dogs in my local area, and after finishing my degree decided to devote my time to petcare, and that's were it all started!</p>
						
						​<p>I currently walk small groups of dogs in the North London areas. I walk only small groups, as I believe that walking a smaller group means that your dog gets the love and attention they need, while at the same time they get to socialize with other friendly dogs.</p>
						
						​<p>I'm very passionate about the work I do. And have excellent references to show this. I am also CRB checked, insured with PetPlan insurance and have reasonable rates!</p>
