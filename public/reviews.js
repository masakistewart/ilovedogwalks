I could not recommend a more caring, reliable and trustworthy person than Emilie.  I feel confident that when Daisy is being walked by Emilie she is in very safe hands. ​"

		body: "Emilie Stewart has been our dog walker for over three years, and we are very pleased with her, as she has done an excellent job looking after our West-Highland White Terrier, walking her every weekday. She always goes the extra mile to accommodate our needs – she is flexible and reliable and always keeps us informed should there be any issue or concern regarding our dog. She is great with animals, and our dog absolutely adores her. We feel our dog is in safe hands with Emilie, and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a dog walker."

We have found Emilie to be hugely reliable, flexible, friendly and thoughtful. She had also helped us train our dog and reinforce good behaviour.We would thoroughly recommend Emilie. "
